# RPA Platform Architectural Migration Plan
## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive architectural migration plan for the RPA platform to address OpenShift security constraints while modernizing the system architecture. The migration introduces a three-layer architecture (Orchestrator → Workers → Browser Services) with centralized TOTP management and OpenShift-native configuration.

### Key Outcomes
- **Resolves**: OpenShift browser automation security restrictions
- **Modernizes**: Configuration management with OpenShift-native services
- **Centralizes**: TOTP authentication with usage tracking
- **Improves**: Resource efficiency with on-demand browser services
- **Maintains**: 100% compatibility with existing Oracle dashboard integration

---

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working (95% Functional)
- ✅ Complete RPA orchestration system deployed in OpenShift
- ✅ Job submission API via Oracle dashboard → ORDS → Database → Orchestrator
- ✅ Database persistence and job queuing operational
- ✅ Orchestrator-to-worker communication via Kubernetes services
- ✅ Job assignment, tracking, and retry logic functioning
- ✅ All networking, routing, and service discovery configured

### The Blocker (5% Issue)
- ❌ Chrome WebDriver fails in OpenShift's security environment
- ❌ Security Context Constraints prevent browser process creation
- ❌ Shared memory access restrictions (/dev/shm)
- ❌ File system permission limitations for browser data directories

---

## Proposed Architecture

### Three-Layer Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Orchestrator  │────│    Workers      │────│  Browser        │
│                 │    │                 │    │  Services       │
│ • Job Management│    │ • Business Logic│    │ • Firefox +     │
│ • TOTP Generation│   │ • Job Execution │    │   Playwright    │
│ • Service Lifecycle│ │ • Result Processing│ │ • Privileged    │
│ • OpenShift Config│  │ • Browser Comms │    │   Container     │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Communication Flow (Pattern A)

```
1. Oracle Dashboard → ORDS → Database → Orchestrator
2. Orchestrator detects browser automation jobs
3. Orchestrator provisions browser service (cold start)
4. Browser service initializes (Firefox + Playwright startup)
5. Browser service signals ready state
6. Orchestrator assigns jobs: Worker + Browser Service pairing
7. Worker executes business logic via browser service API
8. Job completion → Browser service termination
```

## Component Architecture Details

### 1. Orchestrator Layer (Enhanced)

**Current Responsibilities (Unchanged):**
- Job queuing and assignment via existing Oracle integration
- Worker health monitoring
- Business logic coordination
- API endpoints for job submission

**New Responsibilities:**
- Browser service lifecycle management (provision/terminate)
- Centralized TOTP generation and usage tracking
- OpenShift-native configuration management
- Browser service readiness monitoring

**Key Services:**
```python
class BrowserServiceManager:
    - provision_browser_service(job_batch_id) 
    - wait_for_service_ready(deployment_name, timeout=120)
    - terminate_browser_service(service_id)
    - monitor_browser_health()

class TOTPManager:  
    - get_fresh_totp_code(provider, job_id)
    - reserve_totp_code(provider, code, job_id)
    - mark_totp_code_consumed(provider, code, job_id, success)
    - get_totp_usage_metrics(provider, date)

class ConfigManager:
    - load_from_openshift_secrets()
    - load_from_openshift_configmaps()
    - watch_configuration_changes()
```

### 2. Worker Layer (Modified)

**Existing Responsibilities (Preserved):**
- Receives jobs from orchestrator
- Business logic execution
- Results processing and reporting

**Enhanced Responsibilities:**
- Browser service communication via REST API
- Translates business logic into browser automation commands
- Consumes pre-generated TOTP codes from job parameters
- Error handling for browser service failures

**Communication Pattern:**
```python
# Worker → Browser Service API calls:
POST /browser/session/create
POST /browser/navigate 
POST /browser/interact (click, type, etc.)
POST /browser/totp/submit  # Uses orchestrator-generated code
GET  /browser/extract (data scraping)
DELETE /browser/session/close
```

### 3. Browser Service Layer (New)

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Dedicated Firefox + Playwright execution environment
- Runs with elevated OpenShift Security Context Constraints
- On-demand startup/shutdown (cold start pattern)
- Pure automation execution engine
- RESTful API for browser commands

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Browser Engine:** Firefox (better OpenShift compatibility)
- **Automation Framework:** Playwright (modern, container-optimized)
- **Security Context:** Privileged container in isolated namespace
- **Lifecycle:** Ephemeral, stateless execution
- **Resource Limits:** CPU/Memory constraints to prevent resource exhaustion

**Health Monitoring:**
```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
  
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/live
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

## OpenShift-Native Configuration Management

### Current config.py Replacement Strategy

| Current config.py Function | OpenShift Replacement | Security Level |
|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Portal Credentials | OpenShift Secrets | Encrypted |
| TOTP Secrets | OpenShift Secrets | Encrypted |
| System Configuration | ConfigMaps | Plain Text |
| Database Settings | ConfigMaps + Secrets | Mixed |
| Logging Configuration | ConfigMaps | Plain Text |
| Directory Setup | Persistent Volumes + Init Containers | N/A |

### OpenShift Secrets Structure
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: fno-credentials
  namespace: rpa-system
type: Opaque
data:
  metrofiber-url: <base64-encoded>
  metrofiber-email: <base64-encoded>

  log-level: "INFO"
  retry-attempts: "3"
  retry-delay: "60"
  screenshot-retention-days: "30"
```

## TOTP Management System

### Centralized TOTP Architecture

**Problem Solved:** Multiple workers potentially using same TOTP code simultaneously, causing authentication failures.

**Solution:** Orchestrator-managed TOTP generation with Valkey-based usage tracking.

### TOTP Manager Components

```python
class TOTPManager:
    """Advanced TOTP management with Valkey-based usage tracking"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.valkey_client = valkey.Valkey()  # Usage tracking store
        self.totp_secrets = self.load_from_openshift_secrets()
        self.used_codes_ttl = 60  # Track codes for 60 seconds
        
    def get_fresh_totp_code(self, provider: str, job_id: str) -> str:
        """Generate unused TOTP code, rotating if necessary"""
        # Implementation ensures no code reuse across concurrent jobs
        
    def reserve_totp_code(self, provider: str, code: str, job_id: str):
        """Mark TOTP code as reserved in Valkey"""
        # Prevents concurrent usage of same code
        
    def mark_totp_code_consumed(self, provider: str, code: str, job_id: str, success: bool):
        """Track actual consumption with success metrics"""
        # Analytics and monitoring data
```

### TOTP Usage Flow

```
1. Orchestrator detects Octotel job requiring TOTP
2. TOTPManager.get_fresh_totp_code("octotel", job_id)
3. Check Valkey for recently used codes
4. Generate fresh code if current code unused
5. Reserve code in Valkey with job_id
6. Add totp_code to job parameters
7. Worker receives job with pre-generated TOTP
8. Browser service uses TOTP for authentication
9. Mark code as consumed in Valkey with success/failure
```

### Valkey Data Structures

```
# TOTP Code Reservation
totp_used:octotel:123456 → {"job_id": "job_123", "reserved_at": 1638360000}

# TOTP Usage Metrics  
totp_metrics:octotel:2024-01-15 → {
  "codes_generated": 45,
  "codes_consumed": 43, 
  "successful_auths": 41,
  "success_rate": 0.95
}

# TOTP Consumption Tracking
totp_consumed:octotel:123456 → {"job_id": "job_123", "success": true}
```

## Enhanced Security & Production Hardening

### Security Hardening Improvements

**Least-Privilege Security Contexts (Priority P0):**
Instead of full privileged access, browser services will use minimal required permissions:

```yaml
# Enhanced browser service security context
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
    add:
      - SYS_ADMIN  # Required for browser sandboxing only
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault
```

**Service-to-Service Authentication (Priority P0):**
Internal REST API security between orchestrator, workers, and browser services:

```python
# Browser Service API Security
@app.before_request
def authenticate_internal_request():
    """Validate service-to-service authentication"""
    auth_header = request.headers.get('Authorization')
    if not validate_service_token(auth_header):
        abort(403, "Invalid service authentication")

class ServiceTokenManager:
    """JWT-based internal service authentication"""
    def generate_service_token(self, service_name: str, expires_in: int = 3600):
        return jwt.encode({
            'service': service_name,
            'exp': datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(seconds=expires_in)
        }, self.internal_secret, algorithm='HS256')
```

**Valkey High Availability (Priority P1):**
Production-grade Valkey deployment with clustering:

```yaml
apiVersion: redis.redis.opstreelabs.in/v1beta1
kind: Redis
metadata:
  name: valkey-cluster
  namespace: rpa-system
spec:
  clusterSize: 3
  persistenceEnabled: true
  redisConfig:
    maxmemory-policy: "allkeys-lru"
    save: "900 1 300 10"
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "256Mi"
      cpu: "100m"
    limits:
      memory: "512Mi"
      cpu: "200m"
```

### Advanced Scaling Strategy

**Warm Pool Management:**
Enhanced browser service management for peak performance:

```python
class EnhancedBrowserServiceManager:
    """Advanced browser service lifecycle with warm pools"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.warm_pool_size = 2  # Configurable warm instances
        self.business_hours = (8, 18)  # 8 AM to 6 PM
        
    def maintain_warm_pool(self, min_instances: int = 1):
        """Maintain warm browser services during business hours"""
        if self.is_business_hours():
            current_warm = self.count_warm_services()
            if current_warm < min_instances:
                self.provision_warm_services(min_instances - current_warm)
    
    def pre_warm_for_scheduled_jobs(self):
        """Pre-warm before known batch processing windows"""
        scheduled_jobs = self.get_upcoming_browser_jobs(next_minutes=15)
        if scheduled_jobs:
            required_services = min(len(scheduled_jobs), 3)  # Max 3 concurrent
            self.ensure_warm_services(required_services)
    
    def intelligent_scaling(self, queue_depth: int):
        """Scale browser services based on queue depth and patterns"""
        if queue_depth > 10:  # High load
            return min(queue_depth // 3, 5)  # Max 5 concurrent services
        elif queue_depth > 5:  # Medium load
            return 2
        else:  # Low load or off-hours
            return 1 if self.is_business_hours() else 0
```

### Evidence Collection & Audit Management

**Centralized Evidence Manager:**
```python
class EvidenceManager:
    """Centralized evidence collection and audit trail management"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
        self.evidence_bucket = Config.EVIDENCE_BUCKET
        self.retention_days = Config.EVIDENCE_RETENTION_DAYS
    
    def store_screenshot(self, job_id: str, step_name: str, image_data: bytes):
        """Store screenshot in S3-compatible object storage"""
        timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
        s3_key = f"evidence/{job_id}/{timestamp}_{step_name}.png"
        
        metadata = {
            'job_id': job_id,
            'step_name': step_name,
            'timestamp': timestamp,
            'content_type': 'image/png'
        }
        
        self.s3_client.put_object(
            Bucket=self.evidence_bucket,
            Key=s3_key,
            Body=image_data,
            Metadata=metadata,
            ServerSideEncryption='AES256'
        )
        
        return s3_key
    
    def generate_audit_report(self, job_id: str) -> dict:
        """Combine logs, screenshots, and timing data for audit"""
        return {
            'job_id': job_id,
            'execution_summary': self.get_execution_summary(job_id),
            'evidence_files': self.list_evidence_files(job_id),
            'performance_metrics': self.get_performance_metrics(job_id),
            'compliance_status': self.validate_compliance(job_id)
        }
```

### Error Handling & Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Enhanced Resilience:**
```python
class CircuitBreakerBrowserClient:
    """Browser service client with circuit breaker pattern"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(
            failure_threshold=5,
            recovery_timeout=60,
            expected_exception=BrowserServiceException
        )
        self.retry_strategy = ExponentialBackoff(
            initial_wait=1,
            max_wait=30,
            max_attempts=3
        )
    
    @circuit_breaker
    @retry(retry_strategy)
    def execute_browser_command(self, command: dict, timeout: int = 30):
        """Execute browser command with resilience patterns"""
        try:
            response = requests.post(
                f"{self.browser_service_endpoint}/browser/execute",
                json=command,
                timeout=timeout,
                headers=self.get_auth_headers()
            )
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
            
        except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
            logger.warning(f"Browser command timeout: {command}")
            raise BrowserServiceTimeoutException()
        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
            logger.error(f"Browser service connection failed: {command}")
            raise BrowserServiceConnectionException()
```

## Browser Service Monitoring

### Hybrid Monitoring Approach

**Primary: OpenShift Native Monitoring**
- Container health and resource usage
- Pod readiness/liveness probes
- Network connectivity status
- Resource consumption metrics

**Secondary: Orchestrator Business Logic Monitoring**
- Browser service provisioning times
- Playwright/Firefox initialization status
- Job execution success rates
- TOTP authentication metrics

**Enhanced Performance Monitoring:**
- Circuit breaker trip rates
- Evidence collection success rates
- Service-to-service authentication metrics
- Warm pool efficiency metrics

### Monitoring Implementation

**OpenShift Readiness Checks:**
```python
@app.route('/health/ready')
def readiness_check():
    """OpenShift readiness probe"""
    try:
        if playwright_ready() and firefox_responsive():
            return {"status": "ready", "timestamp": time.time()}, 200
        return {"status": "initializing"}, 503
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}, 503
```

**Orchestrator Monitoring:**
```python
def wait_for_service_ready(self, deployment_name: str, timeout: int = 120):
    """Combined OpenShift + custom verification"""
    # 1. Wait for OpenShift pod readiness
    # 2. Verify business logic readiness (/health/browser)
    # 3. Test basic browser automation functionality
    # 4. Return service endpoint information
```
